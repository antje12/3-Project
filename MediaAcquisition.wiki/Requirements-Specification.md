## 3.1 Requirements

Based on the analysis, the functional and non-functional requirements were formalized in the following specification. This table describes the essence of the system and how the group intends to evaluate the final product. The requirements were prioritized using the MoSCoW principle. During this project, the Must, Should, and one of the Could requirements will be implemented, covering all of the R1 and R3 requirements.
